/**
 * Given an array arr[] denoting heights of N towers and a positive integer K. 
 * For each tower, you must perform exactly one of the following operations exactly once.
 * 
 * . Increase the height of the tower by K 
 * . Decrease the height of the tower by K 
 * 
 * Find out the minimum possible difference between the height of the shortest and tallest towers after you have modified each tower. 
 * 
 * Note: It is compulsory to increase or decrease the height by K for each tower. After the operation, the resultant array should not contain any negative integers.
 * 
 * Examples - 
 * 
 * Input: k = 2, arr[] = {1, 5, 8, 10} 
 * Output: 5 
 * Explanation: The array can be modified as {1+k, 5-k, 8-k, 10-k} = {3, 3, 6, 8}.The difference between the largest and the smallest is 8-3 = 5.
 * 
 * Input: k = 3, arr[] = {3, 9, 12, 16, 20} 
 * Output: 11 
 * Explanation: The array can be modified as {3+k, 9+k, 12-k, 16-k, 20-k} -> {6, 12, 9, 13, 17}.The difference between the largest and the smallest is 17-6 = 11.
